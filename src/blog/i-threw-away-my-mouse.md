  **Last year I attended JS Conf Budapest and I watched many great talks but
  “YES! Your site can (and should) be accessible” by Laura Carvajal was the most
  thought-provoking talk for me. Laura explained how the Financial Times made
  accessibility a core part of their development process and she shared several
  lessons she and her team had learned. In her third lesson Throw away your
  mouse, Laura mentioned that just testing with the keyboard wasn’t enough and
  that only going keyboard-only all the time made a difference.**

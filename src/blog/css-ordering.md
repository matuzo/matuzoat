## How I‚Äôm ordering CSS properties now

Honestly, I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs a mix of logical grouping, alphabetical order and just no order at all. It kinda has some structure, but I guess you could describe it as pretty arbitrary.

Here‚Äôs a random class from the current HTMHell website.

```css
.site-intro {
  font-size: 2rem;
  text-align: center;
  font-weight: 700;
  line-height: 1.5;
  max-width: 36ch;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
```

According to [a poll I ran on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mmatuzo/status/1345815183680270340), most people order by type, closely followed by alphabetical ordering. I also did a quick search and, as expected, many people have thought and written about different approaches and the pros and cons compared to others.

## My new approach

Since I don‚Äôt have a strong opinion on the topic and I haven‚Äôt tried different techniques, I will not repeat what others have done already, I‚Äôll just share how I‚Äôll try to write CSS on the new HTMHell website. Switching to a completely new system feels a bit too radical, so I decided to refine and structure my current approach.

I‚Äôm against grouping all properties, because it‚Äôs hard to group all of them sensibly and it‚Äôs hard to remember later which properties go together. I‚Äôm also against ordering alphabetically because I want `bottom` and `right` close to `position` and `align-items` close to `display`. I want strict ordering for properties I use a lot and a loose but structured ordering for the rest. I work my way from the outside in, from the back to the front.

1. **Box model properties**  
   (`width`, `height`, `min-/max-width`, `min-/max-height`, `padding`, `margin`, `border`)
2. **Background**  
   (`background-image`, `background-size`, etc.)
3. **Layout**  
   (`display`, `position`, `justify-content`, `top`, `bottom`, `align-items`, `align-content`, `grid-gap`, `grid-template-columns`, `flex-wrap`, etc.)
4. **Typography**  
   (`font-size`, `font-style`, `font-family`, `color`, `line-height`, `letter-spacing`, etc.)
5. **Everything else**, in alphabetical order

Here‚Äôs an example:

```css
body {
  /* box model */
  margin: 0;
  padding: 2rem 1rem;
  min-height: 100vh;

  /* background */
  background-image: url(../img/bg.png);

  /* layout  */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;

  /* type */
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  line-height: 1.7;
  color: var(--color-text);

  /* other, in alphabetical order */
  box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px 2px #000;
  transition: all 0.3s;
}
```

If I notice that I‚Äôm using a property from the 5th group a lot, I might promote it to one of the other groups. Grouping and sorting is probably unnecessary on such a small site like the one I‚Äôm working on right now, but it‚Äôs an interesting exercise. If It works here, I might try it at work on a larger project with more people involved. If not, I‚Äôll just keep doing whatever feels right to me. üôÉ

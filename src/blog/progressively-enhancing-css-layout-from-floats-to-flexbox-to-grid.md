  When can I start using CSS grid layout?” “Too bad that it’ll take some more
  years before we can use grid in production.” “Do I need Modernizr in order to
  make websites with CSS grid layout?” “If I wanted to use grid today, I’d have
  to build two to three versions of my website.” The CSS grid layout module is
  one of the most exciting developments since responsive design. We should try
  to get the best out of it as soon as possible, if it makes sense for us and
  our projects.

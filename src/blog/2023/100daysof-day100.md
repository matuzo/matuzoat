intro: "It’s time to get me up to speed with modern CSS. There’s so much new in CSS that I know too little about. To change that I’ve started [#100DaysOfMoreOrLessModernCSS](/blog/2022/100-days-of-more-or-less-modern-css/). Why more or less modern CSS? Because some topics will be about cutting-edge features, while other stuff has been around for quite a while already, but I just have little to no experience with it."
teaser: "OMG, I did it, day 100! 4 months and 16 days ago I published the first post and then I wrote another post every workday for 138 days straight without missing a single day. In this final post, I want to do a quick recap and give an outlook for what's coming next."

## Recap

Starting this project was one of the best and worst ideas I ever had. 

It was a great idea because I’m finally up to date with modern CSS. I’ve learned so so much, not just about the fancy new stuff, but also about CSS in general. Based on the feedback I’ve received, I wasn’t the only one who benefited from this project. This format, short, focused posts about a single topic, worked well for many people. That makes me happy. Thank you for reading and participating!

It was a bad idea because it was so much work and it put quite a lot of pressure on me at times. Each post took me at least 1 hour to write, sometimes up to 4 hours. In some weeks, that meant spending an entire working day or more writing these posts on top of my other work. Consequently, the quality of some posts is not as good as I’d like it to be.

Anyway, I’m glad that I finished it. Especially because I’m someone who tends to abandon their side projects quickly since the next more exciting project is already around the corner. 

## My favorite posts

I’m happy with how most posts I’ve written have turned out, but, of course, I have some favorites.

### Top 3 favorite new features

I’ve covered a lot of new features in CSS, but I’m most excited about these.

* [cascade layers (day37)](/blog/2022/100daysof-day37/)
* [container queries (day 56)](/blog/2022/100daysof-day56/)
* [@property (day 84)](/blog/2023/100daysof-day84/)

### Top 3 favorite posts

Like I said, this experiment turned out to not just focus on modern CSS, but core CSS concepts, too. These are 3 of my favorite posts.

* [value processing (day 82)](/blog/2023/100daysof-day82/)
* [!important (day 74)](/blog/2023/100daysof-day74/)
* [typed custom properties (day 85)](/blog/2023/100daysof-day85/)

### Top 3 most useful properties/values

There are certain new features that (will) make my life as a frontend dev much easier.

* [dvh (day 38)](/blog/2022/100daysof-day38/)
* [relative color syntax (day 92)](/blog/2023/100daysof-day92/)
* [scrollbar-gutter (day 20)](/blog/2022/100daysof-day20/)

### Top 3 most surprising features

I honestly knew nothing about, I don’t know, 80%? of the stuff I wrote about before I did my research. Some things surprised me.

* [font palettes (day 75)](/blog/2023/100daysof-day75/)
* [container style queries (day 80)](/blog/2023/100daysof-day80/)
* [CSS Motion Path (day 88)](/blog/2023/100daysof-day88/)

Soooo, now that I’m done, what’s next? Well, I’ll probably not write about CSS too soon again, haha. My personal next step is to implement many of these features and techniques in the websites I’m building to get some actual hands-on experience. Once I have that, I can write blog posts with a bit more substance. I will also talk about my insights as [CSS Day in June](https://cssday.nl/2023).

## Interop 2023

I’m looking forward to learning what’s coming next to the web platform. We can track the progress in the [Interop 2023 Dashboard](https://wpt.fyi/interop-2023?stable). This year’s focus areas are:

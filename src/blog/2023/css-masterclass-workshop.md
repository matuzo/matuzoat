## About the workshop

`clamp()`, `:is()`, `:where()`, `min()`, `max()`, `lab()`, `lch()`, `oklab()`, `oklch()`, cascade layers, container queries, logical properties, `:has()`, `svh`, `dvh`, `lvh`, font-pallets, subgrid…How do you feel when you read these terms? Confused? Interested? Excited? Overwhelmed?  
Well, yeah, that’s how most of us feel. CSS has changed so much in the last few years that it’s almost impossible to stay up-to-date.

2022 and 2023 were critical years for CSS. Browsers got together and began shipping new features week after week almost simultaneously. While that’s good news for us developers, keeping track of and adapting to those changes is challenging.

In **Advanced Modern CSS Masterclass**, a brand new [Smashing Magazine workshop](https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops), I introduce you to the latest and greatest features in CSS.

That’s really important because many will tell you that shadow DOM is a must. After a year of working with web components, I came to the conclusion that shadow DOM can be useful, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be the default. Some things, also regarding accessibility, are easier without shadow DOM. We’ll get into that later.

I’ve summarised some pros and cons of using shadow DOM on my blog in a post called “[The pros and cons of using shadow DOM and style encapsulation](/blog/2023/pros-and-cons-of-shadow-dom/)”.

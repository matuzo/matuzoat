â€¦if you're putting `cursor: pointer` on a `<th>` with a click event attached, you want to use a `<button>` instead.

```html
<th style="cursor: pointer">
  Name
</th>
```
More accessible alternative:

```html
<th aria-sort="ascending">
  <button>Name</button>
</th>
```

## Explanation

Only put click events on interactive elements like `<button>`. `<th>` is not an interactive element and thus not focusable.

It absolutely makes sense because for many people writing CSS means writing JS but I've seen enough pro/con talks about CSS-in-JS. 

I do enjoy talks that are more advanced and show how to optimize the CSS people write in JS but I'd really love to see a CSS only talk or read an article again that challenges the way I write CSS or approach layout and architecture.

I have a feeling that we should talk and write more about CSS, advanced CSS. Tutorials have their place but I'd love to read and hear more about concepts and approaches, layout and architecture. I know that @rachelandrew, @heydonworks and @hankchizl are doing a lot but I believe thereâ€™s more that can be discussed and shared. :)

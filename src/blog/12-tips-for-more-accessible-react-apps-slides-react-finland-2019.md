### About this talk

This talk is called <cite>12 Tips For More Accessible React Apps</cite>. At the time when I picked the title I didn't know how much time I will have so I just picked an arbitrary number and I thought that 12 will be fine.

As it turns out, I only have 20 minutes so let's get started with my 8 tips for more accessible react apps. ðŸ˜„

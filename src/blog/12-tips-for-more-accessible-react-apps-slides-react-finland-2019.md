The [slides for this talk](https://bit.ly/react-tips) are already online if you want to follow along on your laptop.

I'm not a React developer but I know how awesome React is. Today I'm here to give you tips that will help you create better apps and reach more people.

### About this talk

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.004.jpeg)

This talk is called <cite>12 Tips For More Accessible React Apps</cite>. At the time when I picked the title I didn't know how much time I will have so I just picked an arbitrary number and I thought that 12 will be fine.

As it turns out, I only have 20 minutes so let's get started with my 8 tips for more accessible react apps. ðŸ˜„

### <abbr title="acessibility">a11y</abbr> tip #1: Create a sound document outline

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.005.jpeg)

My first tip is: Create a sound document outline.

![&lt;h1&gt;Yo! I'm the title of your page.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I'm very important.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;My parent is very important.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;My parent is very important.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;I exist.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I'm very important.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;My parent is very important.&lt;/h3&gt;](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.006.jpeg)

What I mean by that is that you should start your document with an `h1` and the title of your page.

Large sections, thematic groupings of content, in your page start with an `h2`. If there are subsections use `h3`, `h4`, etc. If there's another large thematic section you go back to the `h2`.

<div class="content__video-wrapper"><div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gbHCgiktPNc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="React demo: VoiceOver navigation by headings"></iframe></div></div>

This is important because screen reader users don't just use the software by reading the contents on a page from top to bottom. There are additional ways of navigation, for example by listing all headings and jumping directly to a specific heading.

In VoiceOver you get a list of all headings. The level is announced with the text of the heading to give users context and understand the page hierarchy.

![&lt;Heading.H&gt;I will be an h1&lt;/Heading.H&gt;&lt;Heading.LevelBoundary&gt;&lt;Heading.H&gt;I will be an h2&lt;/Heading.H&gt;&lt;Heading.LevelBoundary&gt;&lt;Heading.H&gt;I will be an h3&lt;/Heading.H&gt;&lt;/Heading.LevelBoundary&gt;&lt;Heading.H&gt;I will be an h2&lt;/Heading.H&gt;&lt;/Heading.LevelBoundary&gt;](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.007.jpeg)

Sometimes that's hard to get right, especially when you're working with nested components. An `h2` in a component is correct in one place but might be wrong when it's nested in another.

[Tenon UI](https://www.tenon-ui.info/), an accessible React components library, has a component that takes care of that. You start with a `Heading.H` component which will automatically become an `h1` and then you use the `Heading.LevelBoundary` component to create a new section and allow automatic level calculation.

![&lt;h1&gt;I will be an h1&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I will be an h2&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;I will be an h3&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I will be an h2&lt;/h2&gt;](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.008.jpeg)

The result is an automatically calculated correct document outline.

<div class="content__video-wrapper">
  <div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tLSEWdpmYrc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="React demo: Testing the document outline with tota11y"></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

There are many ways of testing the document outline. A quick and easy way is a browser extension called [tota11y](https://khan.github.io/tota11y/).
tota11y annotates headings and shows the document outline. It displays errors if the outline is not correct.

#### Summary of the first tip

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.009.jpeg)

Create a sound document outline because it gives your document structure, helps screen reader users with navigation, and it's important for SEO.

Check out [Tenon UI's headings component](https://www.tenon-ui.info/headings). Test your document outline with [tota11y](https://khan.github.io/tota11y/) or [wave](https://wave.webaim.org/). 

### <abbr title="acessibility">a11y</abbr> tip #2: Hide content correctly

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.010.jpeg)

My second tip is: Hide content correctly.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.011.jpeg)

The React Finland website starts with an `h1` and has a well structured document outline. It's almost perfect, there's just one thing I'd want to improve. There should be a "Sponsors" `h2` that groups the different types of sponsorships.

I guess it's missing because it hasn't been considered in the design either. There might be a reason to leave it away in the design but it should be in the document. The design shouldn't dictate the outline but the content should. What we need here is a heading that's hidden from sighted users but accessible to screen reader users.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.012.jpeg)

`display: none;`, `visibility: hidden`; and the `hidden` attribute are not suitable for hiding content visually because they remove content from the accessibility tree making it inaccessible to screen reader users.

![.visually-hidden { border: 0; clip: rect(0 0 0 0); height: 1px; margin: -1px; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; position: absolute; width: 1px; white-space: nowrap;}](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.013.jpeg)

We need a little bit more than that. A [combination of properties](https://medium.com/@matuzo/writing-css-with-accessibility-in-mind-8514a0007939#81ec) that makes sure that content is still accessible to screen readers but not visible or focusable.

![&lt;h2 className=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;Sponsors&lt;/h2&gt;](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.014.jpeg)

To improve the React Finland website we add a visually hidden `h2` and transform the existing `h2`s to `h3`s.

![&lt;button&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;Save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden width=&quot;32&quot; height=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;path &hellip;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/button&gt;](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.015.jpeg)

You can use this technique as well when you have an icon button without text. You just put the text in a visually-hidden `span` inside the `button` and you've got yourself an accessible button.

![&lt;button&gt;&lt;VisuallyHidden&gt;Save&lt;/VisuallyHidden&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden width=&quot;32&quot; height=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;path &hellip;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/button&gt;](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.016.jpeg)

You could write a component for that or use the existing [VisuallyHidden component](https://github.com/reach/reach-ui/tree/master/packages/visually-hidden) from the [Reach UI React library](https://github.com/reach/reach-ui/).	

#### Summary of the second tip

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.017.jpeg)

`display: none;`, `visibility: hidden;` and the `hidden` attribute remove content from the accessibility tree.
Every item needs a textual representation, even if it isn't visible. Check out Reach UI's VisuallyHidden component.

### <abbr title="acessibility">a11y</abbr> tip #3: Use `<button>` if you need a button.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.018.jpeg)

Tip number 3: Use `<button>` if you need a button.

It's tempting to use `div`s as buttons because they come with less default styling than HTML `button`s but there's a huge difference when it comes to user experience.

I'll show you the difference in the following demo.

<div class="content__video-wrapper">
  <div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K1sdW9GNSwE?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="React demo: Using a HTML button as button"></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

In this example I put a click event on a HTML `button`. You can see that I can click it with a mouse and focus it using the keyboard. I can trigger the event using the mouse or by pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> key.

<div class="content__video-wrapper">
  <div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mbGqcHdCIRA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="React demo: Using a div as button"></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

This button looks the same but this time I'm using a `div` instead of a `button`. I can click the button but I can't focus it, because divs aren't focusable by default. Even if I could focus it, I wouldn't get the key events I get with the HTML `button` element.

A fake button is inaccessible to keyboard and screen reader users. 

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.019.jpeg)
Summary of the third tip: `<button>`s are focusable by default, they come with keyevents for free and they're semantic. A `<div>` is just generic text.

### <abbr title="acessibility">a11y</abbr> tip #4: Use fragments to avoid invalid HTML.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.020.jpeg)

If a component returns multiple elements, they must be wrapped in a wrapper element, for example a `div`. This might cause invalid HTML or break your layouts.

React 16.2 introduced a nice little feature called [Fragments](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html). Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

![const Table = props =&gt; { return ( &lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;Columns /&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; ); }](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.021.jpeg)

Let's say we have table component and in each table row there's a column component.

![const Columns = props =&gt; { return ( &lt;div&gt; &lt;td&gt;Hello&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;World&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ); }](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.022.jpeg)

This is how the `Columns` component looks like. All cells are wrapped in a `div` because we need a wrapper element.

![&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;td&gt;Hello&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;World&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.023.jpeg)

The result is invalid markup because a `div` is not a valid descendent of `tr`.

![const Columns = props =&gt; { return ( &lt;React.Fragment&gt; &lt;td&gt;Hello&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;World&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/React.Fragment&gt; ); }](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.024.jpeg)

This can be fixed by using a `Fragment` instead of a `div`. All you have to do is to replace `<div></div>` with `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>`.

![&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;Hello&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;World&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.025.jpeg)

As a result the component returns the contents without extra markup.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.026.jpeg)

Summary of tip 4: Fragments help you write valid HTML and they reduce bloat. There's also a shorter syntax, you can write `<></>` instead of `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>`.

Check out the Fragments docs for more details and examples.

<img src="/images/twitter_ban.jpg" alt="Screenshot of parts of my Twitter profile that says: Your account is permanently banned. After careful review, we determined you account broke the Twitter Rules. Your account is permanently in read-only mode, which means you can't Tweet, Retweet, or Like content. You won't be able to create new accounts. If you think we got this wrong, you can submit an appeal.">

After careful review, they determined that my account broke the [Twitter Rules](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules). Okay, let's have a look at the rules to get an idea of what could've caused this ban. You break the rules if your tweets contain content related to anything in this list:

* Violence
* Terrorism/violent extremism
* Child sexual exploitation
* Abuse/harassment
* Hateful conduct
* Perpetrators of violent attacks
* Suicide or self-harm
* Sensitive media, including graphic violence and adult content
* Illegal or certain regulated goods or services

I can assure you I tweeted nothing related to any of these things. Also, I didn't spam, I didn't try to manipulate elections, I didn't impersonate anyone, I didn't share synthetic or manipulated media, and I did not violate others’ intellectual property rights.

So, what happened? I have absolutely no idea! Here's a rough outline of the events:

  <p><strong>21.10. Comment on Unas question</strong></p>

  <p>On Friday Una asked on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/mmatuzo/status/1583522924299841537">What do you want to see on the web platform next year?”</a> and I responded “A native sr-only attribute.”. My reply got a bunch of likes and some retweets.<br>
  So, nothing special happened here.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p><strong>22.10. Hidden replies</strong></p>
  <p>But then suddenly on Saturday people reported that <a href="https://twitter.com/openuicg/status/1583680688938631169">they did't see my reply anymore</a>.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="/images/twitter_ban2.jpg" alt="Screenshot Twitter. Instead of my reply it says 'this tweet is unavailable'." loading="lazy">
  </p>

  <p><a href="https://twitter.com/bramus/status/1583822357201711105">Bramus assumed that this was a bug in the Twitter app</a>, but Šime pointed out that <a href="https://twitter.com/simevidas/status/1583913449716711425">I got shadowbanned</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p><strong>23.10. Contacted Twitter support</strong></p>
  <p>On Sunday I contacted Twitter support and reported the ban. I told them that I got shadowbanned for no reason and I asked them to look into the matter.   
  Being shadowbanned means that I can still like, comment, and tweet, but people don't see my content. Also, people can't search for my content on Twitter. For me, everything looks fine, but in reality I'm not reaching anyone. This is usually a measure against spammers.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p><strong>24.10. Permanently suspeneded</strong></p>
  <p>I woke up to the news that my account was permanently banned.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p><strong>24.10. A reply from Twitter</strong></p>
  <p>Later that day, I got a reply to my report:</p>

  <div class="quote">

  <p>In the linked post it says <q>We do not shadow ban. You are always able to see the tweets from accounts you follow.</q>.  
  This is a lie. There's proof in the screenshot above.</p>

  <li>
  <p><strong>24.10. Submitted an appeal</strong>  </p>

  <p>I've submitted an appeal and asked them again to look into the matter and tell me what happened.</p>

  </li>
<li><p><strong>25.10 You ❤️</strong>

  <p>Today I had multiple mails in my inbox from people offering their help and asking if I was okay. You're amazing, thank you! ❤️ I'm fine, it's just annoying.</p>

  <p>Thank you everyone for @-ing Twitter Support (<a href="https://twitter.com/spuz78/status/1584470084231516161">Bernhard</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/m_ott/status/1584648614282133504">Matthias</a>) and retweeting, and especially thank you Bernhard, Matthias, Mike, David, Jenn, Jens, and Sara for getting in touch via e-mail.</p>
  </li>

  <p>What's next? I don't know. I'll just wait for their reply. I'll keep you updated in this blog post.</p>

  <p><strong>26.10 Support and reply from Twitter Support</strong></p>
  <p>
    I'm blown away by the amount of support I've received. Literally 100s of tweets @-ing Twitter-Support. Thank you! Thank you!  Thank you!

  <p>  Some of you even put the message in their Twitter name. 😁</p>

  <p>And others created memes. 😁</p>

  <p>Other than that, nothing much happened except that I've filed another appeal and someone from Twitter Support replied to one of the tweets asking for a case number, which Max provided for me. Let's see what happens next.</p>

  About a year ago I started to focus more on web accessibility. The most
  effective method of learning for me is teaching others. That’s one of the
  reasons why I’m talking at meetups and conferences and why I’m writing
  articles about the topic. I wrote about Progressive Enhancement for Smashing
  Magazine and about accessibility basics here on Medium. This article is the
  third in a series of collections of accessibility tips. They’re in no
  particular order, you can read Writing HTML with accessibility in mind and
  Writing JavaScript with accessibility in mind now or later if you’re
  interested.

  When I found out about flex-grow, I made a simple demo to find out what it
  did and how it worked.


  I thought I got everything figured out, but when I tried it on a website a
  colleague has recently made, nothing worked as expected. No matter what we
  did, the layout didnâ€™t look and work like it did in my demo. That got me
  thinking and I started to doubt that I knew what flex-grow was all about.

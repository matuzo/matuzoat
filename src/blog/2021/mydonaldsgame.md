I watched this video about a rare Nintendo DS game for McDonald‘s trainees and how the guy who made the video finally got his hands on a copy, and I loved it. I was reminded of this video again after reading about [Perplex City](blog/misc/find-satoshi/) recently, so I thought I’d share this video, too.

You can watch the story of the game on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e6xOBCAVvA).

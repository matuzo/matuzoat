It’s hard for me to enjoy surfing the web, because there are just too many things that annoy me: bad performance, pop-ups, too many ads, cookie dialogs, chat bots, push notifications, etc. Call it an occupational disease. Yet there are sites I enjoy using a lot, not because they don’t do the things I’ve listed, but because the service they provide is great.

An example I’ve posted on Twitter often is [who sampled](https://www.whosampled.com/), which lets you search for a song and then lists all songs that have been sampled in this song. For example, have you ever wondered where 2Pac got the piano part in his song [Changes](https://www.whosampled.com/2Pac/Changes/) from? He sampled [The Way It Is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gthpodDZJeQ&feature=emb_title) by “Bruce Hornsby and the Range”. Or did you know that the hook from Fatboy Slims 1998 hit [Praise you](https://www.whosampled.com/Fatboy-Slim/Praise-You/) originally comes from a song called [Take Yo’ Praise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GvPBdDNh5E&feature=emb_title) by Camille Yarbrough? Oh man, I could spend hours on this site.

For Christmas I treated myself with [Smash](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smash_(The_Offspring_album)>) by The Offspring, one of my all-time favorite albums.

If you donâ€™t know Offspring or any song on the album, here are YouTube links to some of my favourite songs on Smash:

- [Something To Believe In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK_gDmweR9Q)
- [Self Esteem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abrn8aVQ76Q)
- [What Happened To You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8sOWiRO3Y)

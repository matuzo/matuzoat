Last year I started jogging again and with increasing regularity I ran 110km in November and December, respectively. Being at home most of the time and the lack of anything better to do helped with that, of course.

January - June: 17.55 km  
July: 30.78 km  
August: 44.31 km  
September: 5.04 km  
October: 51.13 km  
November: 110.97 km  
December: 111.28 km

I have to remind myself constantly of the following: It doesnâ€™t matter what you do or how you perform, but doing any kind of activity regularly is important. Itâ€™s not just good for your personal fitness, but your mental health. Especially for people like us who sit in front of a computer most of the time.

Anyway, the reason Iâ€™m writing is that I feel great today because I broke 3 personal records: I ran 1k in 4:41 min., 5k in 24:55 min. and 10k in 50:49 min. ðŸŽ‰

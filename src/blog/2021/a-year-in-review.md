## Personal

Let me start with the most important thing that happened in 2021: Our daughter Johanna was born on May 19th. I can‚Äôt describe how beautiful the entire experience was and still is. For the first two days, I wasn‚Äôt able to look at her for longer than 5 seconds without tearing up. Everything was just so emotional, beautiful, and overwhelming.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, life with a baby is exhausting, especially compared to how our life was before, but the positive things outweigh the lack of sleep and the new fears you have as a parent. Watching her grow and learn new stuff every day is amazing.

Fun fact: I hid some Easter eggs on HTMHell regarding my daughter. The example I‚Äôm using in [Issue #1 - iframe accessibility](https://www.htmhell.dev/tips/iframe-accessibility/) is [‚ÄúVisions of Johanna‚Äù by Bob Dylan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwuCF5lYqEE) and I‚Äôve listed her as an executive producer in the credits of [my first YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52eL1CCJdi8).  

Another personal highlight of 2021 was our first vacation as a family in Croatia. We enjoyed the time at the sea and camping in our van a lot!

### Conclusion personal

My personal year 2021 was overall great. I‚Äôm getting tired of the whole pandemic situation, but my fiance and I enjoyed the time she was pregnant a lot and the rest of the year as well, of course. I was always bad at work-life-balance and this year it has changed little. While I could keep most weekends work-free and I spent them with my fiance and my daughter, I didn‚Äôt have enough time and energy left for the rest of my family and my friends.

## Work

### Angular and performance

In the first few months, I worked with a team of Angular devs on improving the performance of a large all-in-one productivity app. The job was challenging because most people involved were very skilled and I felt a lot of pressure to deliver visible improvements every week, but I learned a lot in these few weeks and I got to know super nice people. It was a joy to work with them.

### Cats

I worked a lot with the Smashing Magazine team, which is a great honor to me because I‚Äôve been a fan of Smashing Magazine and their work for many years. I became part of their [experts panel](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/about/#smashing-magazine-s-experts-panel), I [gave a talk at a meetup](https://vimeo.com/showcase/9087993/video/654497457) and I held a [workshop](https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops/manuel-matuzovic-apr/).

### The City

At my day job nothing too exceptional happened. This sounds negative, but it‚Äôs actually a good thing because we had time to focus on our new design system and the pattern library. One thing worth mentioning is that I worked quite a lot with [CraftCMS](https://craftcms.com/) and twig. I like Craft because it gives me as a frontend developer a lot of freedom to build templates the way I want.

### Other

Other than that I did some accessibility audits, consulting for an university in Vienna, and several workshops. My favorite gig was a 2-day workshop with the designers and developers of [sipgate](https://www.sipgate.de/). They were so interested, involved and eager to improve the accessibility of their products that it didn‚Äôt feel like work for me. I had a lot of fun and I also learned from them.

### Conclusion work

Considering that I have a full-time job, that sounds like a lot, and it was. All in all, I‚Äôm happy with the quality of my work, but I was stressed out a lot this year, and I did fuck-up one or two tasks.

## Side projects

I‚Äôm really happy with my side projects. I created some pretty cool and useful stuff.

* [DevToolsSnippets](https://github.com/matuzo/DevToolsSnippets), a collection of front-end debugging script snippets to be used in the Sources panel in Chrome DevTools. 
* [The Button Cheat Sheet](https://www.buttoncheatsheet.com/)
* I started the [HTMHell newsletter](https://www.htmhell.dev/newsletter/).
* I recorded the first video for the [HTMHell YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52eL1CCJdi8).
* HTMHell Advent Calendar

## Talks

<p>I didn‚Äôt take part in many calls for papers, but I prepared a new talk and I presented it at 3 events. You can watch <a href="https://vimeo.com/654497457">‚ÄúBuilding The Most Inaccessible Site Possible with Manuel Matuzovic - Smashing Meets For All December 2021‚Äù</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/smashingmagazine">Smashing Magazine</a> on Vimeo. I gave the same talk at <a href="https://webdirections.org/aaa/index.php">Web Directions Access All Areas</a> (I highly recommend this event) and at the German version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFlb0wpXm0s&list=PLLuwoY7nxnR3AXdmA8JYdbjdFMKaereMr">technica11y</a>.</p>

I also did a live stream with my friend Christoph, which was super fun. We tested the accessibility of his website [larastreamers](https://larastreamers.com/).

## Plans for 2022

I didn‚Äôt spend much time thinking about my plans for 2022, but off the top of my head here‚Äôs what I want to do:

* Work less and enjoy life with my family and friends
* Spend more time on writing for HTMHell
* Record videos for HTMHell
* Redesign my personal website
* Finally update my profile pic

I'm looking forward to 2022! ü§óü•≥

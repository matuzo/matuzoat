## Preface

It has already been two years since the first browsers, Chromium 57 and Firefox 52, shipped CSS Grid Layout un-prefixed. Many developers have experimented with it or are using it in production already. More will come as soon as support for Internet Explorer 10 and 11 becomes less important.\
Grid offers many ways of building layouts and it challenges us to rethink the way we approach them. This flexibility is great for our development experience, but it may come at the cost of user experience and accessibility if we donâ€™t use it responsibly.

This series of articles will give you an overview of potential implementation pitfalls, or in other words, the dark side of the grid.

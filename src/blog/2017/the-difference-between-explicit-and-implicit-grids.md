  Grid Layout finally gives us the ability to define grids in CSS and place
  items into grid cells. This on its own is great, but the fact that we don't
  have to specify each track and we don't have to place every item manually
  makes the new module even better. Grids are flexible enough to adapt to their
  items.


  This is all handled by the so called explicit and implicit grid.

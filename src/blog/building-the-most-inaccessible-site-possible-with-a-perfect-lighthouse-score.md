title: Building the most inaccessible site possible with a perfect lighthouse score
metadescription: >-
  If an automatic testing tool tells us that our site is 100% accessible, it
  doesn't necessarily mean that it actually is.

  It’s always nice to see when people post their lighthouse scores on social
  media to highlight how well they’ve optimised their own or their clients
  website. It shows that they care about the quality of what they build.

Lighthouse awards us with the number 100 in a green circle if we did an exceptional job. It’s something you can proudly share with your client or on twitter.
 
It’s important to measure the quality of our code but it’s even more important that we interpret the scores automatic testing tools give us correctly. If lighthouse tells us that our site is 100% accessible, it doesn’t mean it is. It just means we’ve laid the groundwork for manual testing. With automatic testing alone you can’t ensure good quality.
To prove that, I built the most inaccessible site possible with a perfect lighthouse score.

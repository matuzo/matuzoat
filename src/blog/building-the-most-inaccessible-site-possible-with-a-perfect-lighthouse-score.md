  website. It shows that they care about the quality of what they build.

Lighthouse awards us with the number 100 in a green circle if we did an exceptional job. It’s something you can proudly share with your client or on twitter.

It’s important to measure the quality of our code but it’s even more important that we interpret the scores automatic testing tools give us correctly. If lighthouse tells us that our site is 100% accessible, it doesn’t mean it is. It just means we’ve laid the groundwork for manual testing. With automatic testing alone you can’t ensure good quality.
To prove that, I built the most inaccessible site possible with a perfect lighthouse score.

## Background

Zach Leatherman recently posted this on [twitter](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1122184546609446919):

> How to Build the Slowest Website with a Perfect Lighthouse Score

And here’s [Vadim Makeev’s response](https://twitter.com/pepelsbey_/status/1122203926584074240) to his tweet, which inspired me to write this post.

<blockquote>That would be a wonderful read! Here’s one for a11y audit:<br> \\\`&lt;img src=picture.png alt=picture.png&gt;\\\`</blockquote>

I thought it would be a fantastic idea to not just try to mess with as many people as possible, but get rewarded with a perfect lighthouse score on top.

## Let’s exclude as many people as possible

We’ll take this simple, accessible page as a basis.

[![A page with a heading, a link, two paragraphs, a list and a simple form](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1559205173/articles/lighthouse/lighthouse_step1.png)](https://codepen.io/matuzo/debug/vwVRJx)

### 🖕 CSS only 🖕

Let's start nice and easy. I want to make sure that CSS is a dependency on my perfect website. To achieve that I'm adding the `hidden` attribute to the `body` element. `hidden` is the HTML equivalent to `display: none;` in CSS. 

<p class="code-label"><strong>HTML</strong></p>

```html
<body hidden>
  ...
</body>
```

![A blank page](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1559206005/articles/lighthouse/lighthouse_step2.png)

That alone would be enough to exclude everyone and pass the lighthouse tests, but I don't want to make it too easy on myself. I want to create a site that’s perfectly inaccessible and technically still displays content.
So let's add come CSS and bring our content back.

<p class="code-label"><strong>HTML</strong></p>

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body class="loaded" hidden>
  ...
</body>
```

<p class="code-label"><strong>CSS</strong></p>

```css
.loaded {
  display: block;
}
```

We’re back to where we were before but now CSS must load if users want to get access to content on our site.

### 🖕 JS only 🖕

Let’s add one more dependency. I’m not applying the class that displays our content in HTML anymore, but I add it via JS.

<p class="code-label"><strong>HTML</strong></p>

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>

<body hidden>
  ...
</body>
```

<p class="code-label"><strong>JS</strong></p>

```js
  document.querySelector('body').classList.add('loaded');
```

Great! The site still looks the same but in order for it to display anything at all the CSS and JS file must load and work properly.

I'd say it's time for our first lighthouse test. Fingers crossed! 🤞🏼

<div class="lighthouse-test js-lighthouse-test">
<button class="btn js-run-lighthouse-test"><span class="btn__inner">Run lighthouse test</span></button>
<span class="visually-hidden js-lighthouse-status" role="status"></span>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1559207447/articles/lighthouse/lighthouse_test.png" alt="Score: 100" />
</div>

Perfect score on a CSS and JS only site. That's great, but we can do better.

### 🖕 Screen reader users 🖕

There are many ways to exclude screen reader users. The easiest and most efficient way is to remove the whole body from the accessibility tree by adding the `aria-hidden="true"` attribute and value.

<p class="code-label"><strong>HTML</strong></p>

```html
<body hidden aria-hidden="true">
  ...
</body>
```

Screen reader users will now experience one of those _“rare”_ moments when they have to deal with an inaccessible site.

### 🖕 Keyboard users 🖕

Keyboard users navigate through a page by pressing the `Tab` key to jump from one interactive element to another. Browsers show an outline around these items if they’re in focus.

![Focus outline on a text link](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1559208552/articles/lighthouse/lighthouse_step4.png)

Let’s get rid of that.

<p class="code-label"><strong>CSS</strong></p>

```css
*:focus {
  outline: none !important;
}
```

All it takes are 3 lines of CSS to exclude a whole user group from being able to access the site. Although, technically, they can still interact with it. They won’t see the focus indicator anymore but interactive elements are still tababble. Since this experiment is all about exclusion, let’s make sure that the keyboard can’t be used at all.

<p class="code-label"><strong>JS</strong></p>

```js
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
})
```

Our exclusion-first app now removes the default functionality of all keys.

Time for another test.

<div class="lighthouse-test js-lighthouse-test">
<button class="btn js-run-lighthouse-test"><span class="btn__inner">Run lighthouse test</span></button>
<span class="visually-hidden js-lighthouse-status" role="status"></span>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1559207447/articles/lighthouse/lighthouse_test.png" alt="Score: 100" />
</div>

Still perfect.<br />
Okay, now it's time to get dirty.

### 🖕 High contrast mode 🖕

People with low vision can improve contrasts on Windows by enabling the so called [High Contrast Mode](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2016/12/windows-high-contrast-mode-the-limited-utility-of-ms-high-contrast/).

![Windows with high contrasting colors. Black background and yellow text.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1559211531/articles/lighthouse/lighthouse_step5.png)

The whole operating system uses high contrasting colors for all applications including browsers and websites.

We can target high contrast mode users specifically by using a dedicated media feature.

<p class="code-label"><strong>CSS</strong></p>

```css
@media screen and (-ms-high-contrast: active) {
  /* High contrast styling rules */
  * {
    color: #000000;
  }
}
```

Rules in this media query only apply if High Contrast is enabled. Unfortunately, we don’t know which colors the theme uses, nor if it’s a light or dark theme. Setting the color to `#000000` on all elements might or might not work, depending on user preference.
This fifty-fifty chance is not exclusive enough for me, but we’re lucky. Windows High Contrast colors are mapped to CSS system color keywords. This means we can use the specified colors with no need to know them. The background-color is mapped to `window`.  So, let’s use the value of the background color for the text color of all elements.

<p class="code-label"><strong>CSS</strong></p>

```css
@media screen and (-ms-high-contrast: active) {
  * {
    color: window !important;
  }
}
```

Oh, man. This is so evil. My LinkedIn inbox will be filled with job offerings by companies like Facebook and Uber.

### 🖕 Mouse users 🖕

Excluding mouse users is easy, we just remove the cursor.

<p class="code-label"><strong>CSS</strong></p>

```css
*,
*:hover {
  cursor: none;
}
```

`cursor: none;` is to mouse users what `outline: none;`  is to keyboard users. Orientation is annoyingly hard but interactive elements are still clickable. Let's improve the quality of our app by decreasing the user experience once more.

<p class="code-label"><strong>CSS</strong></p>

```css
body {
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

pointer-events: none; frees our users from the ability to click anything on our site. This property is well supported, but if we want to make sure that this feature works on as many browsers as possible, we can apply a principle called progressive degradation™.

<p class="code-label"><strong>JS</strong></p>

```js
function removeA11y() {
  if ("pointerEvents" in document.body.style) {
    console.log('pointer-events supported')
    return;
  }

  document.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
  })
}

removeA11y();
```

This JavaScript fallback will kick in and remove click events from all elements, if the browser doesn't support the pointer-events property.

### 🖕 Readability 🖕

Let's test our code before we move on. 

<div class="lighthouse-test js-lighthouse-test">
<button class="btn js-run-lighthouse-test"><span class="btn__inner">Run lighthouse test</span></button>
<span class="visually-hidden js-lighthouse-status" role="status"></span>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1559207447/articles/lighthouse/lighthouse_test.png" alt="Score: 100" />
</div>

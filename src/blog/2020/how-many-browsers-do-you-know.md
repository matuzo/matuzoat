  While testing a new feature recently, I realised that I don’t know too many browsers. I can list some, but I don‘t really know them like I know Firefox or Chrome. I want to change that, and I invite you to do the same.

[Firefox Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools) have improved so much in the last few years that I naturally switched from Chrome as my main development browser to Firefox. This helped me understand their differences, not just when working (developer experience) but also when surfing (user experience). 
Recently we’ve finished building a new feature, and I wanted to test it on my phone. I went through my apps to see which browsers I have installed. I needed quite some time to find them all because <s>I’m not well organised</s> I use them only for testing and then I forget about them.

## How many browsers do you know by heart?

Okay, try to list as many browsers as possible. I’ll give you a few seconds.

…

Here’s my list: Chrome, Chrome for Android, Firefox, Firefox Mobile, Opera, Opera Mobile, Opera Mini, Vivaldi, IE, Edge, Brave, UC, Firefox Focus, Safari, Samsung Internet, Firefox DE, Safari iOS.

Did you know that there’s a [DuckDuckGo Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android), a browser called [Mint](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mi.globalbrowser.mini&hl=de_AT) with over 5 Million downloads in the Android Play Store or a browser called [Dolphin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.mgeek.TunnyBrowser&hl=de_AT) with over 50 Million downloads?

I didn’t. There are even more browser with millions of downloads.

## Let’s switch browsers

I know how Firefox, Chrome and Safari differ, but I don’t know too much about other browsers and I want to change that. I will switch browsers every two weeks to learn more about them and I invite you to do the same.

So, for the next two weeks I’ll use [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) on my laptop and [Brave](https://brave.com/) on my smartphone and I will share my experience before I switch again.  
If you join me, I'd love to hear about your experience on [twitter](https://twitter.com/mmatuzo) or via [email](manuel@matuzo.at).

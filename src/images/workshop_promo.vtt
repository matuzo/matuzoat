Hi! My name is Manuel and if you know me, you know
that I like to complain about HTML others have

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.880
written. I post about it on Twitter, I even have a
website called htmhell.dev where I post bad code,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.400
but complaining is not the only thing I can do.
I can also, and I also like to, share my knowledge

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.440
and this is why I've teamed up with my friends
at Smashing Magazine. We've prepared a workshop

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.840
called “Deep dive on accessibility testing” where
I show you how I use automatic testing tools,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.160
browser extensions and even CSS and JavaScript,
manual testing, like testing with the keyboard

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.760
and screen readers, to discover these bad
things, to discover accessibility issues.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.520
If that sounds interesting, it would be great if
you would join me for my workshop. Below the video

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.560
you will find a special link with a discounted
price just for you. I hope to see you soon! Tthanks!

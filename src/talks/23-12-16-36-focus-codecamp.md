The majority of users surf the web with a mouse, trackpad or via touch, but there are also users who rely on the keyboard as their primary input device. Manuel MatuzoviÄ‡ will illustrate in his talk who those users are, why there are more of them than you might think and what you as a developer can do to make their lives easier and improve the overall user experience and accessibility of your websites and web apps. You will learn about focus and what you can do with CSS and JavaScript to improve it.

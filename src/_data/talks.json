Sie bringt eine Reihe neuer Eigenschaften, Einheiten, Funktionen und verwandte Spezifikationen mit sich, aber leider auch einige Gefahren. In diesem Talk gibt Manuel Matuzović eine kurze Einführung in CSS Grid Layout und stellt sich besagten Gefahren, indem er die Probleme erklärt und Alternativen vorstellt. Du wirst lernen, was es bei der Arbeit mit Grid zu beachten gibt, warum Source Order wichtig ist, wie man mit Legacy-Browsern umgeht und welche Vor- und Nachteile neue display-Werte haben.",

He wanted to improve his understanding of how it is to use a computer and especially the web only with the keyboard. \n\n He has documented all sites he has visited and the good and bad practices he came across. This talk illustrates the most common issues he encountered and possible ways to fix them. You'll learn why it's important to make websites keyboard accessible and who benefits from it. On top of that, Manuel will share his favorite keyboard shortcuts and some other handy tips and tricks with you.",

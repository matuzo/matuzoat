What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you think about web accessibility? Maybe optimising a website in a way that it’s easier to use with assistive technology like screen readers? Of course, that’s one part, but accessibility is more than that. Accessibility is about making websites and web apps easier to understand and use for everyone. With better accessibility comes better usability and user experience. This talk aims to demystify web accessibility and provide you with simple and practical takeaways, which you can easily incorporate in your workflow today. You are going to get a better understanding of how other people surf the web and find out how to make your web projects more inclusive and improve the usability and user experience at the same time.

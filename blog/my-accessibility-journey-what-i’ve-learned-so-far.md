  Last year I gave a talk about CSS and accessibility at the stahlstadt.js
  meetup in Linz, Austria. Afterward, an attendee asked why I was interested in
  accessibility: Did I or someone in my life have a disability?


  I’m used to answering this question—to which the answer is no—because I get it
  all the time. A lot of people seem to assume that a personal connection is the
  only reason someone would care about accessibility.

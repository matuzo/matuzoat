  Earlier this year, support for CSS grid layout landed in most major desktop
  browsers. Naturally, the specification is one of the hot topics at meet-ups
  and conferences. After having some conversations about grid and progressive
  enhancement, I believe that thereâ€™s a good amount of uncertainty about using
  it. I heard some quite interesting questions and statements, which I want to
  address in this post.
